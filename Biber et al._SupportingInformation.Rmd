**Table S2.** Relative contributions to the overall variation in predicted future species richness from different sources of variance for each species coverage class (see Fig. S5). Values represent median proportions (%) of the total sum of squares from the three-way ANOVA performed for each grid cell evaluating the relative contributions of model type, model algorithm and general circulation model (GCM), as well as their interactions to the variance of predicted future species richness for the two different RCPs, separately for each taxon and each species coverage class. Note that the variance determined by the full interaction cannot be differentiated from the residual (unexplained) variance.
